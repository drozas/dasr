ENGLISH adventurer Ben Southall has been landed the "best job in the world" after being named Tourism Queensland's island caretaker, 
ending a four-month search.

Mr Southall, 34, will move into a three-bedroom beach home overlooking the islands of the Great Barrier Reef and will receive a salary 
package of $150,000 for the six-month contract.

In return Mr Southall will stroll the white sands, snorkel the reef, take care of "a few minor tasks", and report to a global audience 
via weekly blogs, photo diaries and video updates to promote the region.

The new job will be a change from his previous positions as an events manager, charity fundraiser and tour guide.

Mr Southall, who comes from Hampshire, UK and has a Bachelor of Science degree, describes himself as "adventurous" and "crazy". He 
says his love of scuba-diving and snorkelling has made him “practically a fish”, and has vast travelling experience.
